          Sistent is the Layer5 Design System - an open source design system that offers building blocks to create consistent, accessible, and user-friendly interfaces. It's aimed at developers who want to design applications aligned with the same brand and ensure a uniform user experience across different products.

          Sistent leverages Material UI libraries and provides a custom theme on top of it for a consistent look and
          feel. It includes components, icons, and design tokens that developers can readily integrate into their
          applications. By using Sistent, developers can save time and effort while maintaining a high-quality user
          experience throughout Layer5 products.

          <b>Sistent provides a consistent user experience across Layer5 projects and any frontend software projects
            that choose to use Sistent, too.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          'Sistent' is a play on words to ensure that we have a <i>consistent</i> theme, components, design tokens, etc
          across all of the apps that will be using this library. Sistent is a design system that uses the <b>MUI v5
          components</b> and a <b>custom theme provider </b> instead of using the default theme from MUI v5.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sistent is built with Typescript and Reactjs and contains components and a large collection of icons that can
          be reused across projects. If youâ€™re interested in joining the project (please do!), let us know, and we will
          help you get started on contributing.

        <a id="Installation">
          <h2>Installation and Quickstart</h2>
        </a>
        <p>
          To install the Sistent NPM package, run:
        </p>
        <div className="showcase">
          <CodeBlock name="installation" code={codes[0]}/>
        </div>
        <p>
          After installation, you can import Sistent theme and any Sistent
          component from "@layer5/sistent". The component needs to be
          included inside "SistentThemeProvider".
        </p>
        <a id="Example">
          <h2>Taking button as an example:</h2>
        </a>
        <div className="showcase">
          <div className="items">
            <SistentThemeProvider initialMode={isDark ? "dark" : "light"}>
              <div>
